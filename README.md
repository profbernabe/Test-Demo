# Python Practice Assignment

This assignment is designed to help you practice writing very simple Python functions and running tests in VS Code.

You will write **two functions**

---

## Function 1: `add(a, b)`

Write a function named `add` that:

- Takes two numbers, `a` and `b`
- Returns the result of adding the two numbers together

### Examples

```python
add(1, 2) # returns 3
add(1,0) # returns 1
add (2, -3) # returns -1
```

## Function 2: `repeat_word(word, times)`

Write a function named repeat_word that:

Takes a string called word

Takes a number called times, you can assume the number will be positive so you won't have to error check

Returns the string repeated times times
### Examples

```python
repeat_word("hi", 3) returns "hihihi"
repeat_word("ha", 1) returns "ha"
```
